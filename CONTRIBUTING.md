# Contributing to RubioVPN

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to RubioTV. RubioTV is written in PHP 8.x and JavaScript, using a prototype jQuery.

- Pull requests are always created against the [**dev**](https://github.com/RubioApps/RubioVPN) branch.
- Easiest way to start developing RubioVPN is by setting up a development environment (Web server and a IDE like Visual Studio or Netbeans).
